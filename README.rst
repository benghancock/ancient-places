About
-----

This project leverages data on archaelogical sites from `Pleiades`_ and
geographical data from `Natural Earth`_ to make it possible to search
for places of historical significance by country. Pleiades offers
robust search already, but this is one missing feature. This project
is undertaken mainly for personal learning and experimentation, and is
publicly shared in case anyone interested in the underlying data sets
or the technologies used may benefit.
