Overview & Motivation
---------------------

The aim of this project is to allow archaeology enthusiasts, curious
travelers, and amateur historians the ability to search through the
[Pleiades] database using modern-day country names. For the
unfamiliar, Pleiades is a public repository or “gazetteer” of
geographic information about the ancient world. It's an amazing
project, and it offers very robust search already. But country-based
search is one missing feature, and is enabled in this project by
combining data from Pleiades with data from [Natural Earth].

This project was also a way for me to get familiar with new-to-me
technologies using real-world data, particularly the [Echo web framework]
for Golang, and the [PostGIS] extension to the PostgreSQL database. All of
which is to say, while I hope that the end product is useful to those
who may chance upon this humble project, this was also undertaken for
fun and learning.

how the data for this project was prepared on the [guide page](/guide.html).
Or view the documentation in the code repository (see below).


License & Caveats
-----------------

I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the underlying data, including
whether the listed locations actually fall within the named
countries. While building this project, I frequently found unexpected
results (in particular, when a place was located next to a body of
water or very near a border).

This project is free software. For license information, see the public
