Overview & Motivation
---------------------

The aim of this project is to allow archaeology enthusiasts, curious
travelers, and amateur historians the ability to search through the
[Pleiades] database using modern-day country names. For the unfamiliar,
Pleiades is a public repository or “gazetteer” of geographic information
about the ancient world. It's an amazing project, and it offers very
robust search already. But country-based search is one missing feature.

This project was also a way for me to get familiar with new-to-me
technologies using real-world data, particularly the [Echo web framework]
for Golang, and the [PostGIS] extension to the PostgreSQL database. All of
which is to say, while I hope that the end product is useful to those
who may chance upon this humble project, this was also undertaken for
fun and learning.

License & Caveats
-----------------

I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the underlying data, including
whether the listed locations actually fall within the named
countries. While building this project, I frequently found unexpected
results (in particular, when a place was located next to a body of
water or very near a border).

This project is free software. For license information, see the public
