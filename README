About
-----

This project leverages data on archaelogical sites from [Pleiades]
and geographical data from [Natural Earth] to make it possible to
search for places of historical significance by country. Pleiades
offers robust search already, but this is one missing feature.

This project is undertaken mainly for personal learning and
experimentation, and is publicly shared in case anyone interested in
the underlying data sets or the technologies used may benefit. It
is a work in progress ...
