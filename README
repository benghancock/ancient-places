Ancient Places Country Search - Project README
==============================================

About
-----

This project leverages archaeological data from [Pleiades] and spatial
data on country boundaries from [Natural Earth] to make it possible to
search for places of historical significance by country name. Pleiades
offers robust search already, but this is one missing feature.

The two data sets are combined by performing [spatial joins] using the
[PostGIS] extension to the [PostgreSQL] database. User-facing search
functionality is provided via a web application written in Go that
uses the [Echo] web framework.

This project was undertaken mainly for personal learning, and is
publicly shared so that anyone interested in the underlying data or
the technologies used may benefit. It is a work in progress.

Building & Dependencies
-----------------------

To build the database component of this project, you will need to
install or have access to a PostgreSQL database server; you will also
need to install the PostGIS extension, and some other related
command-line tools. See the file `doc/guide.txt` for a full tutorial
on how to retrieve the source data and set up the database.

In order to build and run the web application, you will need a recent
version of the Go programming language (1.19 or later recommended). To
build from source, use the command `go build` inside this
repository. This will create a binary called `ancient-places`, which
will then run and serve the project over HTTP.

To build the HTML versions of the documentation, you will need
[pandoc], and optimally, GNU Make. Although the HTML docs may be
generated without Make, the `Makefile` in this repository includes
to do this. With Make installed, you should be able to build the whole
project (aside from the database) just by running:

```
$ make
```
