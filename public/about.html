<h1 id="overview-motivation">Overview &amp; Motivation</h1>
<p>The aim of this project is to allow archaeology enthusiasts, curious travelers, and amateur historians the ability to search through the <a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/">Pleiades</a> database using modern-day country names. For the unfamiliar, Pleiades is a public repository or “gazetteer” of geographic information about the ancient world. It’s an amazing project, and it offers very robust search already. But country-based search is one missing feature, and is enabled in this project by combining data from Pleiades with data from <a href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth</a>.</p>
<p>This project was also a way for me to get familiar with new-to-me technologies using real-world data, particularly the <a href="https://echo.labstack.com">Echo web framework</a> for Golang, and the <a href="https://postgis.net/">PostGIS</a> extension to the PostgreSQL database. All of which is to say, while I hope that the end product is useful to those who may chance upon this humble project, this was also undertaken for fun and learning.</p>
<p>One important note is that the Pleiades places returned when searching by country name do not necessarily fall <em>exclusively</em> within that country’s borders; only a part of the place may overlap with that country’s territory. Features spanning a large geographic area, (e.g. the <a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/59822">Ganges River</a>), will appear in searches for a variety of countries. In other words, places have a one-to-many relationship with modern day countries. Please also note that results may not always be correct; see the caveats mentioned below.</p>

<h1 id="license-caveats">License &amp; Caveats</h1>
<p>I made efforts to check that my methods in combining the two data sets produced expected results. That said, I cannot vouch for the accuracy or completeness of the data – including whether the listed places actually fall within the named countries. When inspecting the data, I found instances where places fell into no country at all (usually when located next to a body of water) or into an unexpected country. For more notes on this, see the guide.</p>

<p>I chose Syria for the home page image because it is the home of the ancient crossroads of <a href="https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/668331">Palmyra</a>, a place I find particularly fascinating.</p>
